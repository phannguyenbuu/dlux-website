When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive or by contacting us directly. Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you service related communications, including notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy.\n• Changing or Deleting Your Personal Data: You may change any of your personal information by visiting the website and following the directions therein or by emailing us at support@dlux.com. You may request deletion of your personal data by us, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to honour your request, but please note that we may be required to keep such information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives. We may also retain your information for fraud prevention or similar purposes.\n• You may, of course, decline to submit personal data through the website, in which case, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. You can review and correct the information about you that we keep on file by editing your account settings or by contacting us directly at support@dlux.com.\n\n\nCHILDREN’S PRIVACY\n\nProtecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Thus, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 18, please do not attempt to register for the Service or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, phone number, or email address. No one under age 18 may provide any personal data for accessing the Service. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under age 18, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under the age of 18, please contact us.\n\n\nMERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS\n\nIn case of a merger or acquisition, we reserve the right to transfer all the information, including personal data, stored with us to the new entity or company thus formed. Any change in the website’s policies and standing will be notified to you through email.\n\n\nLINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES\n\nOur website contains links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorisation or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.\n\n\nNOTIFICATION PROCEDURES\n\nIt is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via e-mail notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the website, as determined by us in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n\nDO NOT TRACK\n\n• Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform website and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\n• We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the opt-out links. However, we do not recognise or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.\n\n\nOPTING OUT OF INFORMATION SHARING\n\n• We understand and respect that not all users may want to allow us to share their information. If you do not want us to share your information, please contact us through the support@dlux.com and we will remove your information as soon as reasonably practicable. When contacting us, please clearly state your request, including your name, mailing address, email address and phone number.\n• However, under the following circumstances, we may still be required to share your personal information:\n• if we are responding to court orders or legal process, or if we need to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.\n• If we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use or as otherwise required by law.\n• If we believe it is necessary to restrict or inhibit any user from using any of our Site, including, without limitation, by means of “hacking” or defacing any portion thereof.\n\n\nPHISHING OR FALSE EMAILS\n\nIf you receive an unsolicited email that appears to be from us or one of our members that requests personal data (such as your credit card, login, or password), or that asks you to verify or confirm your account or other personal information by clicking on a link, that email was likely to have been sent by someone trying to unlawfully obtain your information, sometimes referred to as a “phisher” or “spoofer.” We do not ask for this type of information in an email. Do not provide the information or click on the link. Please contact us on the contact details provided on the website if you get an email like this.\n\n\nCHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY\n\nWe may update this Privacy Policy and information security procedures from time to time. If these privacy and/or information security procedures materially change at any time in the future, we will post the new changes conspicuously on the website to notify you and provide you with the ability to opt out in accordance with the provisions set forth above.\nContinued use of our website and Service, following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.\n\n\nBREACH OF PRIVACY POLICY\n\nWe reserve the right to terminate or suspend any account or delete certain contents from any profile or public domain within the ambit of this website if the said account or content is found to be in violation of our privacy policy. We sincerely request you to respect privacy and secrecy concerns of others. The jurisdiction of any breach or dispute shall be determined in accordance with the terms of use of the website.\n\n\n\nNO RESERVATIONS\n\nWe do not accept any reservation or any type of limited acceptance of our privacy policy. You expressly agree to each and every term and condition as stipulated in this policy without any exception whatsoever.\n\n\nNO CONFLICT\n\nThe policy constitutes a part of the user terms. We have taken utmost care to avoid any inconsistency or conflict of this policy with any other terms, agreements or guidelines available on our website. In case there exists a conflict, we request you to kindly contact us for the final provision and interpretation.\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, our practices relating to the website, or your dealings with us, please contact us at support@dlux.com."

Khách hàng có quyền yêu cầu hủy vé với điều kiện báo trước thời gian quy định, thường được tính bằng ngày hoặc giờ trước ngày diễn ra sự kiện, chuyến đi, hoặc lịch trình phục vụ. Việc hoàn tiền phụ thuộc vào thời điểm hủy vé, loại vé được mua và các điều kiện cụ thể của từng sản phẩm dịch vụ. Các loại phí hủy sẽ được áp dụng tương ứng, ví dụ như phí hủy toàn phần, phí hủy một phần hoặc không được hoàn tiền trong trường hợp hủy trễ hạn quy định. Để thực hiện hủy vé và yêu cầu hoàn tiền, khách hàng bắt buộc phải liên hệ với bộ phận chăm sóc khách hàng thông qua các kênh hỗ trợ chính thức như email, điện thoại hoặc hệ thống quản lý trực tuyến. Mỗi yêu cầu sẽ được xem xét và xử lý dựa trên chính sách từng thời điểm. Trong một số trường hợp, nhà cung cấp có thể đề nghị chuyển đổi dịch vụ thay vì hoàn tiền nhằm tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho khách hàng. Tuy nhiên, các trường hợp bất khả kháng như thiên tai, dịch bệnh, hay thay đổi pháp luật cũng được xem xét đặc biệt theo từng hoàn cảnh. Chúng tôi cam kết minh bạch, công bằng trong việc giải quyết mọi yêu cầu hủy và hoàn vé nhằm bảo vệ tốt nhất quyền lợi khách hàng."
